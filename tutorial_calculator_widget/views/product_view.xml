              In order to be able to do mathematical computations on a field you simply have to apply the widget
              'calculator'. Once you've added the widget on a field you can do mathematical formulas within this field.
              If the field is an integer it will be rounded (so nothing behind the comma).
              If the field is a float it will be computed with the decimal precision.
              The user its locale and digits separator are also taken into account.
